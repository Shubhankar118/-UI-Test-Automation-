Key Files and Directories:
src/test/java/testPackage/baseClass/BasePage.java: Contains the base class with WebDriver setup and teardown methods.
src/test/java/testPackage/testCases/: Contains test cases such as login, search, checkout, and payment functionalities.
src/test/resources/config/: Holds configuration and locator files.
testng.xml: TestNG configuration file that controls the execution order of tests.
pom.xml: Maven project file for dependency management.
.gitignore: Defines files and directories to be excluded from version control.
README.md: Documentation file for project setup and usage.
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Java JDK (version 8 or higher)
Apache Maven (for managing project dependencies)
Git (for version control)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-compatible IDE
Browser Drivers:
ChromeDriver for Chrome
GeckoDriver for Firefox
EdgeDriver for Microsoft Edge
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Import the Project into Your IDE:

Open your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
Import the project as a Maven project.
Install Maven Dependencies: Maven automatically manages the required dependencies, but you can trigger the installation manually by running the following command:


mvn clean install
Configuration
1. config.properties
This file is located at src/test/resources/config/config.properties and contains essential configuration settings:

properties

# Browser Configuration: chrome, firefox, edge
browser=chrome

# Base URL of the application under test
testurl=https://example.com
2. locators.properties
This file is located at src/test/resources/config/locators.properties and holds the XPath locators for web elements:

properties

# Login Page Locators
usernameField=//input[@id='user-name']
passwordField=//input[@id='password']
loginButton=//input[@id='login-button']
Running the Tests
You can execute the tests using TestNG either through Maven or directly from your IDE.

Using Maven
In the project root directory, run the following command to execute the test suite defined in testng.xml:


mvn test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=testng.xml
Using an IDE
Ensure the project is imported as a Maven project.
Right-click on the testng.xml file.
Select Run As > TestNG Suite to execute the tests.
Test Execution Flow
Base Setup: The BasePage.java class initializes the WebDriver instance based on the browser specified in config.properties, loads the configuration and locator properties, and navigates to the application’s URL.

Test Cases:

LoginPage.java: Tests the login functionality of the application.
SearchPage.java: Tests the search feature.
CheckOutPage.java: Tests the checkout process.
PaymentPageTest.java: Tests the payment workflow.
Teardown: After all tests are executed, the tearDown method in BasePage.java closes the WebDriver and quits the browser instance.

Future Enhancements
Given more time, the following improvements can be made to enhance the functionality and usability of this framework:

Page Object Model (POM) Implementation: Refactor the framework to follow the Page Object Model for better scalability and maintainability.
Data-Driven Testing: Use external data sources (e.g., Excel, CSV) for running tests with different sets of input data.
Parallel Test Execution: Enable parallel test execution to reduce the time taken for test completion.
Enhanced Reporting: Integrate tools like Allure or ExtentReports for more comprehensive test reports.
Cross-Browser Testing: Extend the framework to support more browsers and platforms for comprehensive test coverage.
Continuous Integration (CI): Set up CI pipelines with tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate test execution on each code commit.
Trade-offs
While building the framework, some trade-offs were made to keep it simple and focused on the core functionalities:

Simple Structure vs. Page Object Model: Currently, the structure is straightforward, but refactoring to POM would improve maintainability as the project scales.
Manual WebDriver Setup vs. Automation: WebDriver setup is done manually, which can be automated further using WebDriverManager.
Basic Reporting vs. Advanced Reporting: TestNG’s default reports are used, but integrating more sophisticated reporting tools can give better insights into test execution results.
